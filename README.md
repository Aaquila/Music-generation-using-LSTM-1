# Music-generation-using-LSTM
SML project by Kalyan Ainala and Aaquila Mariajohn

Single LSTM.ipynb is the file used to run the code.

The dataset folder contains the .mid data used in the Single LSTM.ipynb code

The LSTM_music1.mid, LSTM_music2.mid, LSTM_music3.mid, LSTM_music4.mid are the music files which are generated(output).



Future works: Music generation for polyphonic music i.e. music files where more than a single instrument is used.
